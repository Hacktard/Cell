# Cell

##Introduction

It is an attempt to clone the functions of the basic building block of life, i.e. the cell. 

##Present Objectives

First of all to set up all the basic functions a cell basically does like intake of food, synthesis, transportation through the Endoplasmic Reticullum etc.
For reference, interested programmers who have less experience in biology may refer to the sites mentioned below:

1. http://www.shmoop.com/biology-cells/prokaryotic-cells.html
2. http://www.ivyroses.com/Biology/Cells/Prokaryotic-Cell-Structure.php
3. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prokaryote

...and many others.

 > Note:
 
 > Our focus right now is on the simplest of cells that are bacterial prokaryotic cells. This is very much a theoretical approach and not a pratical one.
  
One could also google for terms and stuff.

Any improvisations on this approach are heartily welcomed. 

>Additional Note:

>All the code(mostly the cell functions) is written mostly in C++,Python or even Javascript. These are supplemented with psuedocodes and any commits for code in any other language like Java, Pascal etc. would be welcomed.
>Plus if anyone helps us in making our algorithms better, then his or her efforts would be sincerely apppreciated.
